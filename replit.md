# GTN Engineering IT Helpdesk System

## Overview

The GTN Engineering IT Helpdesk System is a comprehensive Flask-based web application designed to manage IT support tickets within an organization. The system features role-based access control with three distinct user levels (Super Admin, Admin, and User), automatic system information capture, and a complete ticket lifecycle management system.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: Multi-database support with automatic detection
  - PostgreSQL: Primary production database (default)
  - SQL Server: Enterprise production database with pyodbc connector
  - MySQL: Alternative production database with PyMySQL connector
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Server**: Gunicorn WSGI server for production deployment

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Flask
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 for responsive design
- **Icons**: Remix Icons for consistent iconography
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for client-side interactions

### Application Structure

## Key Components

### Database Models
1. **User Model**: Handles user authentication, profile information, and role management
2. **Ticket Model**: Manages support tickets with full lifecycle tracking
3. **TicketComment Model**: Enables comment system for ticket updates

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Super Admin**: Full system access, user management, ticket oversight
- **Admin**: Ticket management, assignment capabilities
- **User**: Ticket creation and personal ticket management

### Automatic System Detection
- IP address capture for user tracking
- System name detection for better support context

- Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- CSRF protection enabled

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Session-based login with role verification
2. **Ticket Creation**: Users submit tickets with automatic system info capture
3. **Ticket Assignment**: Admins can assign tickets based on category specialization
4. **Ticket Management**: Status updates, comments, and resolution tracking
5. **Reporting**: Excel export functionality for administrative oversight
